# Identity Management for Multitenant Applications in Microsoft Azure

This sample shows how to manage user identities in a multitenant application on Microsoft Azure, using Azure Active Directory for authentication.

The project consists of:

- A reference implementation of a multi-tenant SaaS application. To get started with the application, see [Running the Surveys application][get-started].
- [Written guidance][guidance] on best practices for identity management in multitenant applications on Microsoft Azure. The written guidance reflects what we learned in the process of building the application. 

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.
