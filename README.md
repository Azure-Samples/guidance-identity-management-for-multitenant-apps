# Identity Management for Multitenant Applications in Microsoft Azure

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/expd24tusuu7cowc/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/mspnp/multitenant-saas-guidance/branch/master)

This project consists of:

- The Tailspin Surveys application, a reference implementation of a multi-tenant SaaS application.
- Written guidance on best practices for multitenant applications in Microsoft Azure.

The written guidance reflects what we learned in the process of building the application. To get started with the application, see [Running the Surveys application](docs/running-the-app.md).
